Hi reader, I have covered almost every points including mandatory and optional points.

There are 4-5 remote api calls, the remote servers are basically free weather api providers in the web.

I have created this project using mvvm architecture, and I have used dagger as dependency injection.

I used xml as front end and kotlin to implement logics and render the data into their corresponding ui's and views.

I used horizontal recycler view to display daily wise and hourly wise weather report data into the applications' screen.

There is a single Activity kotlin class with a single ViewModel class, I have used retrofit2, okhtp, gson converter and HttpUrlConnection libraries, to hit remote apis and fetch the relevant data, in the application.

I hope you enjoy this readme file while reading these texts, all the best.
